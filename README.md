# DirectX12
This is a DirectX application that will be developed over time to display some simple graphics. 


The matthew5Windows project is a very simple component that makes it easy to 
create a window and get basic messages from it. It is limited in functionality.


These projects are based on the https://github.com/davants/Matthew5_Ver_1_000.
See that source for Licensing documentation.
